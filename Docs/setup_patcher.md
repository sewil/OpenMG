## Patcher setup
Using the native patcher, create a FTP server with anonymous read access, using the following directory structure:
- Maple
  - download
    - FullVersion
      - MSSetup.exe - Used if patching fails for some reason.
  - patch
    - notice
      - 000xx.txt - The version changes file.
    - patchdir
        - 000xx
          - 000xxto000yy.patch - The patch file, generated by the PatchCreator (using `make-patches`)
          - NewPatcher.dat - The new patcher to download (renamed from .exe)
          - Version.info - Generated by the PatchCreator, contains the checksum of the new patcher and the version to patch from.
